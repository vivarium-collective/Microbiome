# Template Vivarium Project

Visit [the Vivarium Core
documentation](https://vivarium-core.readthedocs.io/) to learn how to
use the core Vivarium engine to create computational biology models.
Check out the
[getting started](https://vivarium-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html)
guide of the documentation. 

## Using this Template
This repository contains a skeleton project you can build on to create
your own models. Go to the 
[github page](https://github.com/vivarium-collective/vivarium-template) 
and select `use this template`.

What follows is a template `README.md`.

# Project Name

<!--
TODO: Microbiome Multiscale Modeling
-->

The aim of this project is to develop a multiscale model of the microbiome. To achieve this, we initiated the project by implementing flux balance analysis (FBA) for E. coli as the first step. Subsequently, we advanced to dynamic flux balance analysis (dFBA), which allows for modeling the flux at each time-step. Below, you can find the link to the Jupyter Notebook corresponding to each step of our project.
