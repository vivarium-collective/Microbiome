<!--
TODO: Microbiome Multiscale Modeling
-->

The aim of this project is to develop a multiscale model of the microbiome. To achieve this, we initiated the project by implementing flux balance analysis (FBA) for E. coli as the first step. Subsequently, we advanced to dynamic flux balance analysis (dFBA), which allows for modeling the flux at each time-step. Below, you can find the link to the Jupyter Notebook corresponding to each step of our project.
